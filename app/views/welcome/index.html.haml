      %span.big Hello!
      I am a designer with over 30 years experience in the composite and plastics industry. My philosophy is to use natural products whenever possible and to learn from the world around us.

      I am a freelance sports and industrial designer with a strong interest in ecological design. I began my career designing sports hardware and have designed the Lendal and Double Dutch kayaks, canoes and paddles for the last 30 years. My designs have changed the shape of the sport and won many Olympic and World Titles.
